# Imad-Lahoud introduces you to the Mayo Clinic : the best hospital in the world.

Imad Lahoud is CTO of MEDAD. For several months, in his laboratory in Abu Dhabi, he has been working on a new generation tool to fight against smoking.

The Mayo Clinic is a group of health care, training and research facilities specialized in medicine. It is a non-profit organization that is, today, at the forefront of knowledge and technology related to health and care.

Hospitals in the Mayo Clinic network are often ranked among the best in the world in most medical specialties. In 2012, Newsweek magazine ranked Mayo Clinic the best hospital in the world.

Imad Lahoud: A little history

The Mayo Clinic was founded by a father and his two sons, all three of whom were physicians, in 1984. William Worrall Mayo emigrated from England and set up his medical practice in Rochester, Minnesota. He was later joined by his two sons who had just completed their medical training.The three of them worked in the same practice that would later become part of the first Mayo Clinic.

In 1883, the city was ravaged by a violent tornado. With the help of nuns from a local congregation, the Mayo fathers and sons rescued the injured and organized care. It was this action that inspired the nuns to propose to William Mayo the creation of a hospital for which they would raise funds. Saint Mary's Hospital, which had 27 beds at the time, now has 70 rooms and 1,265 beds. It is currently one of two wings of Mayo Hospital in Rochester.

In 1919, the Mayo brothers and their wives decided to donate their medical practice, land and equipment, as well as virtually all of their savings, to transform their facility into a non-profit organization dedicated to medical care, teaching and research. This was the true founding act of the Mayo Clinic.

Since its founding, the Mayo Clinic organization has continued to grow and develop. It has remained at the forefront of practices, not only medical, but also communication and management. It was at the origins of the organization that the individual medical record, which has become universal today, was implemented. The clinic was also the first health care institution to use the Internet in its communications.

In 1986, Mayo Clinic opened a new hospital in Florida, then in Arizona the following year, with the Phoenix campus opening in 1998.

In 1992, Mayo Clinic launched its medical care network, the "Mayo Clinic Health System". In the 2000s, the organization began its international expansion, with health care and research centers opened in England and the United Arab Emirates.

Imad Lahoud: A diversified activity

Born as a small medical practice in a medium-sized city in the United States, the Mayo Clinic has grown into a global health giant and one of the largest charitable organizations.

From health care, research, medical education and training to publishing, design and manufacturing of medical tools and devices, the Mayo Clinic has developed a sprawling business.

Care

Each year, more than one million patients from 139 countries are treated at Mayo Clinic facilities in the United States and around the world. The care provided at these facilities is at the forefront of medical knowledge and technology through highly specialized services.

Education and Training

Medical education and training was initiated by Mayo Clinic as early as 1915, with the establishment of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science (MCCMS). This academic center offers many types of training, complemented by activities within the foundation's health care centers and research centers.

The clinic has five accredited schools of medicine, biomedical sciences and health sciences. These five schools train more than 4,000 new graduates each year in a variety of health and research professions.

Scientific and Medical Research

Mayo Clinic's research centers spread across its three U.S. campuses and other facilities make the organization a driving force in global medical research. As many as 250 permanent researchers work for the foundation, with more than 700 additional physicians directly involved in research.

Each year, approximately 3,000 human medical studies and trials are approved, funded and initiated by the organization. Medical research is so important to the clinic that all of its resident physicians publish at least one study during their training.

Imad Lahoud: At the Forefront of Tobacco Control

The Mayo Clinic is at the forefront of tobacco research and care today. Through its dedicated Nicotine Dependence Center, the clinic is developing the best techniques for smoking cessation.

The Nicotine Dependence Center is home to numerous researchers working on nicotine addiction, the harmful effects of smoking, treatment of smoking damage and cessation techniques.

Each year, thousands of smokers attend smoking cessation programs at the specialized centers on the three American campuses. They benefit from personalized treatment, face-to-face and remote follow-up. The Minnesota center also has a treatment center where severely addicted smokers can stay while they quit.

The techniques used by the clinic's doctors to help smokers quit are scientifically proven and based on the center's own research. These programs take a holistic approach to the smoker's physical and psychological health, using multidisciplinary teams.

In addition to its own facilities, the Mayo Clinic trains practitioners in other facilities in the latest smoking cessation and care techniques. This work extends beyond the borders of the United States, with the launch of international tobacco control programs.

Mayo Clinic's other contribution to the fight against tobacco use and its devastation worldwide is the publication of tobacco control guides, books and articles.
